Airwave is an implementation of the idea that every function ever written should have its own endpoint. Whether your system has one function or ten thousand, the ease of testing and deployment should be the same.

The only provider currently supported is Amazon Web Services (utilizing Lambda and API Gateway), but more providers are coming in the future.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install airwave -g
```
